Chapter 1: Working with data.

In this project we're using EF Code First Technique
	1) Create a class which represents the entity that u're gonna insert into DB
	2) Add the Dataset for the newly created class in ApplicationDbContext
	3) Run add-migration <migration name>
	4) Run update-database. Done

According to current repository pattern, when adding a new table you have to
	1) Create the Interface which derives from IRepositoryBase for that specific table
	2) Add the table to repositories (Class which implements the previously created interface)
	3) Add reference for the new table in startup file (service.addScoped);
